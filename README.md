# FH Room Checker

**[FH Room Checker](https://fh-room-checker.vercel.app/)** is a full-stack room availability application built for FH JOANNEUM. It solves a common campus frustration: arriving at a room to find it occupied. By reverse-engineering internal timetable data, this app provides a real-time view of which rooms are free now, which will be free soon, and detailed schedules for every room.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Real-Time Availability**: Instantly see which rooms are "Free Now" and for how long.
*   **Smart "Free Time" Logic**: Unlike standard timetables that show *occupied* times, this app calculates and displays *free* time slots.
*   **Building & Room Filtering**: Browse calendars and availability for specific buildings (e.g., AP152, EA11 in Graz; ES30i in Kapfenberg).
*   **Full Schedule View**: Detailed day-by-day timeline for every room.
*   **Mobile Optimized**: Built with Ionic and Capacitor for a native-like experience on iOS and Android.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The project has evolved from a prototype into a robust full-stack solution.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
*   **Framework**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) (v18+) & [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) (v8)
*   **Mobile Runtime**: [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) (v7) for iOS/Android builds.
*   **Styling**: SCSS with Ionic components.
*   **State**: RxJS for reactive state management.

### Backend (`/backend`)
*   **Framework**: [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (v12).
*   **Language**: PHP 8.2+.
*   **Database**: SQLite (default)/MySQL.
*   **API**: RESTful API to serve room and building data.
*   **Logic**: Custom algorithms to parse FH schedule raw data into "availability" blocks.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+) & npm
*   PHP 8.2+ & Composer
*   Ionic CLI (`npm install -g @ionic/cli`)

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install PHP dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
4.  Run migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
5.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install Node dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Configure environment:
    *   In production, the frontend should use same-origin `/api` routes on Vercel.
    *   Set `BACKEND_API_URL` and `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` in Vercel so the server-side proxy can reach Laravel.
4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    ionic serve
    ```
    The app will run at `http://localhost:8100` (or `4200`).
